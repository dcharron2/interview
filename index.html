				<h3>Do you think the internet has a positive or negitive effect on the future?</h3>
			<p>For me personally, I think that there is good and bad in just about everthing and the internet is such a large "thing", you can barely comprehend it in your mind. A few bad things about the internet is that we are so inveloped in it that we are less aware of the enviroments around us. </p>

			<h3>why do you want to be a designer?</h3>
			<p>I like to create and i thought that i could make a career out of it. I took classes in highschool which i enjoyed. I dont think i would be able to free lance though until i build confidence and skill im pretty basic and don't know what im doing 80% of the time. </p>

			<h3>What frustrates you about design?</h3>
			<p>A few things that frustrates me about design is that it can be hard to translate your ideas onto the computer. And just because you have good ideas doesnt mean the client will like them, i kinda feel like a puppet in some ways.</p>
